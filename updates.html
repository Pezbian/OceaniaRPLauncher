Patch Notes: 08/09/2020 
Shelby's endless quest for stability:
- Recreated the new car DLC from scratch to be more resource friendly and removed 400+ unused/unnecessary files
- The above had a weird side affect of fixing the orp_emotes issues - now you can /e sit and /e foldarms and everything like you used to, it's fixed
- Added a car garage near 0.0 in case anyone does fall through the world they have convenient vehicle access
- Tire smoke and Neons now cost $0 since they don't stick, so change them as much as you like for free
- Cheap faggio and scorcher rentals also placed near 0.0 for players who get yeeted but don't have any cars/bikes in their garage :fingergun: Just hop on to rent
- Lowered amount of peds and messed with the traffic spawning config due to players receiving PedPoolSize errors since the latest FiveM update; hopefully it helps
- A memorial wall has been built at the cemetery featuring a list of familiar names.

Patch Notes: 07/09/2020
Stability improvements:
- Clothing DLC split into two DLC, which doesn't mean much to you but on the back end it's good and it may improve server stability
- All the disabled new Ymaps have been re-enabled and had their blips re-enabled, now you can go back to exploring the church, ice cream shop, pearls restaurant and the DOJ. Only Monster Imports remains closed.

Patch Notes: 06/09/2020 
Whilst we're working on stability fixes..
- Unused assets have been removed from loading on server boot

- [Shelby] Bank heist fence prices increased
- [Shelby] The ammunation on Popular Street is now robbable. Doing so will get you some items, a weapon and cash.
- [Shelby] Be aware: You're robbing a store that sells weapons, so PD may act more aggressively if its to prevent harm. 
- [Shelby] One of those above mentioned items (gun tool kits) are now an important part of gun crafting to make it harder to obtain high-tier weapons - there's a few too many so early.
- [Shelby] Gun tool kits are illegal items.
- [Shelby] Lockpicks, Handcuffs and Cuff keys are no longer scrappable

Patch Notes: 07/07/2020

- [Pez] Fixed the lights issue with the BCSO Pickup (Again)
- [Shelby] Craft system fix: Fertilizer now gathering correctly with shovel and appropriate item limit

- [Shelby] Chop Shop fixed: High tier vehicles weren't giving out any items when chopped, this has since been fixed.
- [Shelby] Fixed glovebox inventories. You're only meant to be able to store 5kg in there (enough for a gun or some small items) instead of it holding hundreds of KGs.
- [Shelby] Off-road vehicle trunk capacity decreased slightly. Vans have had a large trunk inventory increase
- [Shelby] Changed how the EMS and PD hospital revive circle works - No more prompt, simply be someone with either a PD or EMS role with a dead body in the circle and after a moment it should kick in automatically and revive that person. Let me know if there are any difficulties - but basically due to issues we've changed it this way to hopefully make it more reliable.
- [Shelby] Early revive fee has been dropped from $5000 to $2000
- [Pez] Altered the way the /steal command works. A hot key also exists, but RP that out.
- [Pez] Altered the way lockpicks and lockkits work. Lockpicks now have a slightly higher chance of breaking and won't carry through with the hotwire. Lockkits are now a single use item everytime you hotwire a car. Unlocking doors with either type remain unchanged.
- [Shelby] Added some new clothing items. Cat ears for the boys (due to a certain furry lawyer), Ryzen hoodies for girls and boys (including a cropped hoodie colour variant for girls), Supreme two-toned sweatshirts for men (including a white/orange colourway because I noticed some people are into that..) some 'pants on backwards' T-Shirts and 3 new hairstyles for girls (two replacing some shitty hairstyles, one brand new at the end of the list)

- [Shelby] Pacific bank prompt area for accessing bank menu moved to make sense.
- [Shelby] 2 pesky delivery spots have been changed in the EMS delivery job.
- [Shelby] Weazel news billing menu was showing up for other players. This has been fixed.
- [Shelby] Lock Kit's now also act as a way to open car doors - like a lockpick - stand near the car and 'use' the item. This does consume 1 lock kit.
- [Shelby] Sulphur and Fertilizer mining areas have been changed to a new method. The old one simply wouldn't load unless force restarted and is currently under investigation. You still need a shovel, though!
